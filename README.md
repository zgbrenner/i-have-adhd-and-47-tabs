## The two-minute version

Most AI answers are technically correct and operationally useless. They begin with a preamble, hide the actual answer in paragraph four, hand you eleven equally weighted options, and end with “hope this helps.”

**I Have ADHD and 47 Tabs** changes the shape of the answer:

1. The answer or next action comes first.
2. Multi-step work becomes small numbered actions.
3. Long lists are capped, grouped, and ranked.
4. Context is restated when a project spans multiple turns.
5. The response ends when the useful part ends.

It works for **research, studying, writing, planning, email, administrative work, life logistics, and technical tasks**. It is a response-formatting skill, not a medical tool, and no diagnosis is required.

## Before and after

<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Before

> Great question! There are several ways to approach planning your week. You may want to think about your priorities, deadlines, energy levels, meetings, errands, and personal obligations. One strategy is time blocking, while another is using a prioritized task list...

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### After

> **Open your calendar and block the three deadlines first.**
>
> 1. Add anything due this week.
> 2. Reserve one work block for each deadline.
> 3. Put errands into one shared block.
> 4. Leave one unscheduled recovery block.
>
> Next: open your calendar and add the nearest deadline.

## What is different from the original?

This is a browser-first, general-purpose adaptation of **[Ayoub Ghriss’s original `i-have-adhd`](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd)** skill. It keeps the original ten-rule structure while broadening the examples and behavior for everyday questions, research, school, writing, planning, administrative work, and technical tasks.

The key adaptation is simple: factual questions lead with the **answer**, while tasks lead with the **next action**.

## The rules

1. Lead with the answer or next action.
2. Number multi-step tasks.
3. End with one concrete next step when work remains.
4. Suppress tangents.
5. Restate workflow state across turns.
6. Use concrete time estimates when useful.
7. Make progress and wins visible.
8. Describe errors matter-of-factly.
9. Keep lists short, grouped, and ranked.
10. Remove preambles, recaps, and empty closers.

The full instructions live in [`i-have-adhd-and-47-tabs/SKILL.md`](i-have-adhd-and-47-tabs/SKILL.md).

## Zero-cost local validation

This repository intentionally uses **no GitHub Actions or hosted CI**. Validation and releases run locally so maintaining the project does not consume GitHub Actions minutes.

```bash
make check
```

Optional one-time setup installs a local pre-push hook that runs the same checks before every push on your computer:

```bash
make install-hooks
```

No third-party Python packages are required.
